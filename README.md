The following was an attempt to clone a website, could hardly finish anything, unfortunately. However tried my level best to do as much as possible all by myself. Could not give enough time due to CTs but will try my best to clone it as much as possible even if not selected


The following code was written with the help of inspect tab and the google drive folder where the images were taken from.

Styling upto a decent extent is done for the navigation menu. The first 2 images "human" and "kind" were successfully added to the website!!

The links were made and the styling for them to not have the blue colour text and underline was taken care of using text-decoration:none; command in CSS and color: black;
